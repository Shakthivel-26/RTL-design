# RTL-design


This repository contains Verilog-based RTL implementations of various **digital logic designs**, organized into:

- ‚úÖ Combinational Circuits
- ‚è±Ô∏è Sequential Circuits
- üß† Finite State Machines (FSMs)

Each module includes:
- Dataflow, Structural, and Behavioral Verilog models
- Simulation-ready Testbench
- Clear file/folder structure
